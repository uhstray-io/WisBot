# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Build & Run

```bash
dotnet restore        # Restore NuGet packages
dotnet build          # Build the project
dotnet run            # Run the bot (requires discord.key file with bot token)
dotnet build -c Release  # Release build
```

No test framework or linter is configured.

## Deployment

A multi-stage `Dockerfile` builds a Linux image (`dotnet/aspnet:10.0` base — the web layer uses Kestrel). Voice natives: `libsodium` + SQLite ship cross-platform via NuGet; `opus` is installed in the image via `apt` (`libopus0`, symlinked to the unversioned name `DllImport("opus")` probes). Config (token, guild ID, paths) is supplied at runtime via env / an env file — never baked into the image.

CI: `docker-build.yml` validates the image builds on every PR; `build-and-publish.yml` builds and pushes to `ghcr.io/uhstray-io/wisbot` on merge to `main` and on `v*` tags. The image is then deployed by the **agent-cloud** platform (pull image → Ansible-templated `.env` from OpenBao + site-config → Semaphore). The legacy self-hosted-runner deploy workflows have been removed; `deploy-o11y.yml` remains pending migration to agent-cloud's o11y service. See `docs/plans/2026-06-01-agent-cloud-deployment-alignment.md`.

## Architecture

C# .NET 10.0 console application — a Discord bot with voice recording, welcome messages, and reminders.

### Source Files

- **Program.cs** — Entry point. Creates `Terminal` and `Bot` with bidirectional references, runs both concurrently via fire-and-forget tasks, blocks with `Task.Delay(-1)`.
- **Bot.cs** — Discord client lifecycle, event subscriptions, slash command registration and execution. Manages `DiscordSocketClient` connection. Owns service instances and wires events.
- **Terminal.cs** — Async console I/O with a `ConcurrentQueue<string>` log buffer (max 1000 lines). Dispatches terminal commands (`/testrecord`, `/removeallcommands`, `/gc`, `/clear`) that call into Bot.
- **Database.cs** — Static helper. Owns the SQLite connection string (`wisbot.db`) and runs `CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS` for all service tables on startup.

### Services (`Services/`)

- **VoiceRecorder.cs** — Voice channel audio capture. Stores per-user audio as timestamped sparse `AudioChunk` objects in a `ConcurrentDictionary<ulong, UserAudio>`. Reconstructs sparse chunks into continuous PCM, writes WAV files via NAudio `WaveFileWriter`. Optionally merges multi-user recordings into a single file.
- **WelcomeService.cs** — Handles `UserJoined` events. Sends a randomized welcome message the first time a user joins a guild; tracks welcomed users in the `welcomed_users` DB table to suppress re-welcomes on rejoin.
- **ReminderService.cs** — One-shot reminder scheduler. Persists reminders to the `reminders` DB table. Background loop fires every 30s, claiming due reminders atomically via `DELETE ... RETURNING`. Delivers via DM with channel mention fallback. Also owns `TryParseDuration` / `FormatDuration` static helpers.
- **VoiceNotificationService.cs** — One-shot voice presence notifications. Watches `UserVoiceStateUpdated` for a user entering a channel (not hopping or leaving). Atomically claims watchers via `DELETE ... RETURNING` and DMs them with a joinable deep link (`https://discord.com/channels/{guildId}/{channelId}`).
- **VoiceStatsService.cs** — Handles the `/voicestats` slash command. Queries the `voice_activity` table to compute per-user stats.
- **StatusService.cs** — Handles the `/status` slash command. Returns a monitoring snapshot of the bot process.
- **WebService.cs** — ASP.NET Core / Kestrel web host. Serves `GET /health` for container/orchestration checks (200 once the gateway is connected, 503 while starting). Bound to `WISBOT_HEALTH_HOST`/`WISBOT_HEALTH_PORT` (`+`/`*` → all interfaces). Started from `Bot.StartBot`. Will host the Phase 8 file-relay upload/download endpoints.
- **UploadService.cs** — Handles the `/upload` slash command (Phase 8 file relay). Mints an unguessable (128-bit base64url) link backed by a `pending` row in the `uploads` table; replies ephemerally with `WISBOT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL/u/{id}`. The web endpoints (WebService) make the link functional.
- **WisLlmService.cs** — Handles all `/wisllm` subcommands (ask, clear, compact). Guild sessions shared; DM sessions scoped per user.
- **UserVoiceActivityTracker.cs** — Passively records every voice channel join/leave to the DB.

### Startup Flow

```
Program.cs → new Terminal() + new Bot(terminal)
           → terminal.Bot = bot  (bidirectional link)
           → terminal.NewTerminal()  (async console loop)
           → bot.StartBot()          (Discord connection + event setup)
           → Task.Delay(-1)          (keep alive)
```

### Audio Recording Pipeline

1. `/recording start` → `JoinAndRecordChannel()` connects to voice channel via `IAudioClient`
2. `StreamCreated`/`StreamDestroyed` events track users joining/leaving mid-session
3. `ReadStream()` loop reads 3840-byte frames (20ms at 48kHz/16-bit/stereo), creates timestamped `AudioChunk` per frame; a 5-second read timeout detects broken streams and nulls them for re-subscription
4. `/recording stop` → cancels recording tasks (10s timeout), unsubscribes events, disconnects; calls `SaveAllUsersAsWav()` which reconstructs sparse chunks into continuous PCM (filling gaps with silence) and writes WAV files to `./recordings/`
5. Optional: `MergeAudioFiles()` sums all user WAVs into one file by mixing 16-bit samples with clamping

## Conventions

- **Manual constructor DI** — `Terminal` is injected into all services; `DiscordSocketClient` is additionally injected into services that need to call Discord APIs after startup (`ReminderService`, `VoiceNotificationService`). No DI container.
- **Service file pattern** — Each service lives in its own file under `Services/`. `Bot.cs` owns instances, wires events, and handles slash command routing. `Database.cs` owns schema for all services.
- **Discord timeout pattern** — Long operations use `Task.Run()` fire-and-forget after immediate `RespondAsync()`, then `FollowupAsync()` for results (avoids 3-second Discord interaction timeout)
- **Thread safety** — `ConcurrentDictionary` and `ConcurrentQueue` throughout; background service lists use `lock` where needed
- **Audio constants** — 48kHz sample rate, 16-bit depth, 2 channels (stereo), 3840 bytes per 20ms frame
- **Config** — All settings resolve via `Config.Load()` in this order: process environment variable → local `.env` file → default. The Discord token may also come from a `discord.key` file at repo root (gitignored, local dev). Site-specific values (`WISBOT_GUILD_ID`, test IDs, `WISBOT_DB_PATH`, `WISBOT_RECORDINGS_DIR`) are env-configurable — never hardcoded. `WISBOT_GUILD_ID` is required (fail-fast in `InitBot`). See `.env.example`.
- **Recording output** — WAV files saved to `./recordings/` with pattern `{username}_{timestamp}.wav`
- **Command registration** — Slash commands are registered idempotently on `OnReady` (checks existing before creating); use `/removeallcommands` terminal command to force-clear all registered commands
- **Database** — SQLite via `Microsoft.Data.Sqlite`. Single file at `Config.DbPath` (default `wisbot.db` at app root; override with `WISBOT_DB_PATH`). All tables declared in `Database.Initialize()`. Discord `ulong` IDs are stored as `long` (SQLite INTEGER) and cast at the boundary. ISO 8601 strings (`"O"` format) used for `DateTime` storage.
- **Atomic reminder claiming** — `DELETE ... RETURNING` used to atomically consume due reminders, preventing double-delivery on restart

## Key Dependencies

- **Discord.Net 3.19.0-beta.1** — Beta version required for voice audio stream features (`IAudioClient.GetStreams()`). `GuildMembers` privileged intent required for `UserJoined` events (must be enabled in Discord Developer Portal).
- **NAudio 2.2.1** — WAV file writing and audio format handling
- **Microsoft.Data.Sqlite 10.0.5** — Embedded SQLite database, no server required
- **libsodium 1.0.20** — Discord voice encryption; ships cross-platform natives (linux/osx/win-x64) via NuGet
- **OpusDotNet.opus.win-x64** — Opus codec native, **Windows-only** (csproj-scoped to Windows builds). On Linux the container installs `libopus0` via `apt` (see Dockerfile)
- **Concentus.Oggfile** — Included but not currently used

# Coding Conventions for Claude

## C# 14 & .NET 10 Coding Conventions

You are an expert .NET 10 developer. Follow these "Modern & Simple" rules:

### 1. Modern C# 14 Syntax (Mandatory)
* **Field-backed Properties:** Use the `field` keyword for properties with logic to avoid manual backing fields.
    * *Bad:* `private string _name; public string Name { get => _name; set => _name = value; }`
    * *Good:* `public string Name { get; set => field = value?.Trim(); }`
* **Null-Conditional Assignment:** Use `?.=` for defensive assignments.
    * *Example:* `options?.LoggingLevel = LogLevel.Debug;`
* **Extension Blocks:** Use the new `extension` keyword for grouping extension members (properties, methods, and static members).
* **Primary Constructors:** Use primary constructors for classes and structs unless complex initialization logic is required.
* **Collection Expressions:** Always use `[]` for empty or populated collections/spans (e.g., `List<int> items = [1, 2, 3];`).

### 2. General Style & Clean Code
* **File-Scoped Namespaces:** Use `namespace MyProject.Models;` (no curly braces for the namespace).
* **Implicit Usings:** Rely on implicit usings. Do not include standard system imports unless unique.
* **Var Keyword:** Use `var` only when the type is obvious from the right side of the assignment (e.g., `var list = new List<string>();`). Use explicit types for method returns or literals (e.g., `int count = 5;`).
* **Expression-Bodied Members:** Use `=>` for simple one-line methods and properties.
* **Top-Level Statements:** Use Top-Level Statements for entry points (Program.cs).

## 3. Performance & Safety
* **Span Optimization:** Prefer `ReadOnlySpan<char>` for string parsing and slicing.
* **Required Members:** Use the `required` keyword for properties that must be initialized via object initializers instead of bloating constructors.
* **Raw String Literals:** Use `"""` for multi-line strings or JSON to avoid escaping quotes.

## 4. Naming Conventions
* **PascalCase:** Classes, Methods, Properties, Public Fields.
* **camelCase:** Local variables, method arguments.
* **No Underscores:** Avoid `_` prefixes for private fields (since we use the `field` keyword or `this.` prefix if absolutely necessary).


## For Claude

Each time we complete the changes, we need to use 'dotnet build' to test and validate the changes worked.
When making changes, please ensure that the code is well-structured, follows best practices, and includes appropriate error handling. 
If new information is needed to complete the task, please ask for clarification before proceeding.
After completing the changes, please consider making changes to CLAUDE.md and or README.md to reflect the changes made and to provide clear documentation for future reference.

## Repo Memory

Claude stores project knowledge in `.claude/memory/` (committed to git).
At the start of every session, read `.claude/memory/MEMORY.md` to load context.
Use `/repo-memory` to save or retrieve memories.

### Recalling Information

Before answering questions about project decisions, conventions, or context,
check `.claude/memory/` first — read `MEMORY.md` for the index, then open
relevant files. This is the team's shared knowledge base.
